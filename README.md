This project aims to develop a system that provides real-time flight status updates and notifications to passengers. The system consists of various components, including a frontend user interface, a backend server for business logic and data integration, a database for storing flight and user information, and a notification system for delivering updates.

Tech Stack
Frontend:

React.js: Used to build the user interface, displaying current flight status, delays, cancellations, and gate changes. Axios is used for making API requests.
Backend:

Flask (Python): A lightweight web framework used for developing the RESTful API that serves flight data and handles notification requests.
Kafka/RabbitMQ: Used for handling message queues and processing notifications efficiently.
Database:

PostgreSQL: A relational database used to store flight data, user information, and notification preferences.
Notification System:

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): Used for sending push notifications to users' mobile devices.
Kafka/RabbitMQ: For queuing and processing notification messages, ensuring reliable delivery.
Additional Tools and Libraries:
Axios: For making HTTP requests from the React frontend to the backend API.
Kafka Python: A Python client for Kafka, used for producing and consuming messages in the notification system.
JSON: For data interchange between the frontend, backend, and notification systems.
SQLAlchemy: (if used) An ORM for handling database operations in a more Pythonic way.
Docker: (optional) For containerizing the application to ensure consistency across different environments.
Git: For version control and collaboration.
Summary
The system is designed to provide passengers with real-time flight status updates and notifications through a user-friendly interface. It integrates with airport systems for accurate data and utilizes a message queue system for efficient notification delivery. The architecture ensures scalability, security, and reliability, making it a robust solution for handling real-time updates in a dynamic environment.
